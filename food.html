          Known for its diversity that varies with every region, state,
          community, culture and even religion, food in India is a vibrant
          assortment of uncountable dishes. It is distinctly characterised by
          the subtle and sophisticated use of spices, grains, fruits and
          vegetables that are all grown in the country. Home to people of many
          religions who come from a plethora of cultural backgrounds, the food
          culture of the country has been influenced by all of them, including
          foreigners.

                An excellent example of Indian culinary evolution is the sweets.
                Treats such as ladoos (sphere-shaped sweets), chenna podo
                (touted as the first cheesecake of South Asia), jalebi
                (deep-fried sweet pretzel), ghevar (disc-shaped sweet cake) and
                rosogolla (syrupy dessert), have all been a benchmark of how
                basic techniques like baking, roasting, frying (deep and
                shallow) and steaming were perfected to create classics.

          The versatility of Indian cuisine made Babur (founder of the Mughal
          dynasty in India) work towards developing the Mughlai cuisine. The
          evolution in the design of Indian food also came according to a
          10,000-year-old science that made our culinary ecosystem not only
          about the taste but also about wellness. This defined many of the
          techniques that led to the creation of a plethora of interesting
          dishes like rasam (consomm√©), kanjis (gruels that help develop the
          gut), bhapa (steam) and kashayam .
