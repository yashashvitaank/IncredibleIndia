          India takes pride in flaunting its unsurpassed heritage; eras over
          eras have influenced, moulded and face lifted the rich heritage of
          which we all are part of. Distinctive edifices, perennial culture and
          the determination to keep this incredibility have preserved for us an
          era no short of marvels. With a startling number of places and
          monuments enlisted in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, India
          has made an indelible mark in world history.

            With the shifts in ruling powers, India has become the thriving hub
            of multiple architectural marvels. From the world famous Taj Mahal
            to the creative genius Khajuraho temple, the power of architecture
            taste blended with the Indian culture and landscape has no equal.
            The bounty of beautifully sculptured temples like Sun Temple at
            Konark and the Brihdeeswar Temple at Thanjavur make them national
            treasures. Similarly, the majestically rock-cut Ellora Caves in
            Aurangabad and the Portuguese built Churches in Goa have a special
            place in the Indian heritage. While most of the architecture is
            well-documented, there are many relics that exist in all their glory
            without any recognition. Known or unknown, the wide and thriving
            Indian heritage in any respect has certainly received accolades from
            across the globe.

          The realm of culture among other form of heritage in India has
          amplified and grown manifold over the time. The cultural bank
          overwhelmed with creative aspects like art, music, dance and
          literature has been offering bonus pride to the country and
          countrymen. Right from the regional festivities to the national
          celebrations, culture seems to show off its mighty influence all
          through. On the other hand the tinges of crafts, religion, customs,
          traditions, beliefs, philosophy, history, health, medicine, travel,
          cuisine, monuments, literature, painting and languages can by no means
          be neglected as vital features that make the culture heritage of India
          rich and exceptional. <br /><br>
          The rich heritage of India, one of the worldâ€™s oldest civilizations,
          is an all-embracing confluence of religions, traditions and customs.
          The highlights of Indian heritage lie in the treasure of its art,
          architecture, classical dance, music, flora and fauna, and the innate
          secular philosophy of its people. A visit to the heritage sites is
          like a walk through history, changing lanes with every dynasty that
          ruled Indian soils. The finesse of Indian handiwork, the richness of
          silk and cotton textiles, the ethnicity of jewellery, everything has
          come down as a heritage from ancient times and is being kept alive
          generation after generation.
