        <p class="para">
          The history of India starts with the existence of India itself as It
          located in the continent of Asia, India covers 2,973,193 square
          kilometers of land and 314,070 square kilometers of water. Making it
          the 7th largest nation in the world with a total area of 3,287,263
          square kilometers. Surrounded by Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh to the
          North East, China to the North, Pakistan to the North West, and Sri
          Lanka on the South East coast.<br /><br />
          India is a land of ancient civilizations. India's social, economic,
          and cultural configurations are the products of a long process of
          regional expansion. Indian history begins with the birth of the Indus
          Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases are
          usually described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic age. Hinduism arose in
          the Vedic period. The fifth-century saw the unification of India under
          Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism, and it is in his reign that
          Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam
          came to India for the first time and by the eleventh century had
          firmly established itself in India as a political force. It resulted
          in the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded
          by the Mughal Empire, under which India once again achieved a large
          measure of political unity.

        It was in the 17th century that the Europeans came to India. This
        coincided with the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, paving the way
        for regional states. In the contest for supremacy, the English emerged
        'victors'. <br /><br />
        The Rebellion of 1857-58, which sought to restore Indian supremacy, was
        crushed; and with the subsequent crowning of Victoria as Empress of
        India, the incorporation of India into the empire was complete.The
        British Raj was divisive and pit Indians against one another, on the
        basis of religion; and also mistreated the laborers. The Indians were
        essentially slaves of the British rule and were working hard without any
        returns on their work. This, naturally, led to multiple mutinies; and
        prominent freedom fighters came to the forefront. Different ideologies
        of thought believed that there were different ways of gaining freedom;
        however, they all had one common goal - freedom. The British queen had
        asserted that the aim of the British was to help India progress -
        however, multiple problems arose without the consultation of Indian
        leaders. One important instance of this was when in the First World War,
        Britain launched an attack on Germany on behalf of India, even though
        India did not wish for that to happen; and millions of Indian soldiers
        were at the forefront of the British Indian Army during both the world
        wars - further fuelling the Indian resistance. Over a million Indian
        soldiers were killed in both the World Wars. It was followed by India's
        struggle for independence, which we got in the year 1947.

          European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent
          by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the East
          India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established
          themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the
          Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the
          British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades
          following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably
          the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885.The
          period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the
          Montaguâ€“Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the
          unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The
          discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent
          movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas
          Karamchand Gandhi.During the 1930s, the reform was gradually
          legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting
          elections.The next decade was beset with political
          turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final
          push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by
          the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was
          capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the
          bloody partition of colonial India into India and Pakistan.
