          One of the oldest civilization in the world, India is a mosaic of
          multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad
          attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist
          destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km,
          extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain
          forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India
          stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains
          and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.
          Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards
          and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between
          the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you
          travel the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances
          of cuisines, faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes,
          history and adventure sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the
          old and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky
          shopping malls, and majestic monuments accompany luxurious heritage
          hotels, the quintessential traveler can get the best of both worlds.
          Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat or cruise through the
          golden Thar, India has options galore for all.

          India remains one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the
          world. Apart from its many religions and sects, India is home to
          innumerable castes and tribes, as well as to more than a dozen major
          and hundreds of minor linguistic groups from several language families
          unrelated to one another. Religious minorities, including Muslims,
          Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains, still account for a
          significant proportion of the population; collectively, their numbers
          exceed the populations of all countries except China. Earnest attempts
          have been made to instill a spirit of nationhood in so varied a
          population, but tensions between neighbouring groups have remained and
          at times have resulted in outbreaks of violence. Yet social
          legislation has done much to alleviate the disabilities previously
          suffered by formerly “untouchable” castes, tribal populations, women,
          and other traditionally disadvantaged segments of society. At
          independence, India was blessed with several leaders of world stature,
          most notably Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who were
          able to galvanize the masses at home and bring prestige to India
          abroad. The country has played an increasing role in global affairs.
